### JobVP - Job finding and recruitment supporter

**Notice:**  You might want Expo Go on your phone to run smoothly instead of running on a virtual machine in your PC. 

Because we built the project with Expo SDK 50, meanwhile the Expo Go on Google Play uses SDK 51; therefore, you'll either need to find a way around to get SDK 50 Expo Go, or manipulate the expo package in node_modules your way to upgrade to SDK 51. 

The first one is more recommended. Here's a way for Android:
